- Helper method to get only the prefix, or the full_title string, for use in headers? Perhaps title() with no argument?
- Customize delimiter?
- Multi-level titles?
- Handle "%s" in title= (not full_title=)?
- Perhaps _self.title = "Full title"_ for full and _self.title << "Prefix"_ for prefix? Ties in with multi-level.
